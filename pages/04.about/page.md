The Mediator theme for Grav is a direct port of the [Mediator Theme for Jekyll](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator) designed by [Dirk Fabisch](http://blog.base68.com/about/) which in turn was inspired by the [Readium 2.0 Theme for Ghost](http://www.svenread.com/readium-ghost-theme/).

You can **download** the theme here: [github.com/getgrav/grav-theme-mediator](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-theme-mediator) but it's strongly advised to download the complete [Download Mediator Skeleton](http://getgrav.org/downloads/skeletons#extras).

You can find out more info about customizing your Grav theme, as well as basic Grav usage documentation at [learn.getgrav.org](http://learn.getgrav.org)

You can find the source code for Grav at [github.com/getgrav/grav](https://github.com/getgrav/grav)
